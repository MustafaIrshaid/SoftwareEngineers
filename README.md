Any User/Manager will have the ability to give their feedbacks to the program which can be viewed and replied to by an Admin.
An Admin can send notifications for all the users using an easy to deal with Frame.
For the Weather, it's connected with an API which provides us full informations of the current weather and the weather for 7 days ahead.
Any User/Admin will have the ability of getting the weather for his saved location or even any entered location around the world.
